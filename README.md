## To-do

_in no order_

-   Save game functionality
-   Loading screen for terrain generation
-   Rivers
-   Chance of ice?
-   Center cursor to screen view
-   Modify board.py so it creates a console rather than being passed one (in every instantiation)
-   Building num cap, but adjacent tiles make "larger" buildings (and also cost a little more?)
-   Add constants for research screen
-   Add functionality to "placed" bonuses for buildings
-   Add "unlocks" functionality to research to unlock buildings
